# E-Commerce Demo

## It is a basic example of an E-Commerce, which connects to the backend with the stripe api, which allows me to receive payments with cards and more than 25 payment methods.

### The app is built with create-next-app, firebase auth, axios, express, stripe, tailwind and react-router-dom.

Follow the instructions in folder api README for the  `server`.

1. Install dependencies

From this directory run:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the react app

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the react server running on localhost:4242. Note that the
backend server runs on localhost:5252, but the React UI will be available at
localhost:3000. API requests to your backend are proxied by the
create-react-app server using the `proxy` setting in `./package.json`.
